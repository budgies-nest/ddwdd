# Forbidden Sanctum of the Raven Priest 

*The sanctum of the Raven Priest is situated deep in the snowy plains, away from busy roads. Lately it was squatted by a party of cultists. Rumors say that the sanctum is rich with treasures of gold.*

1. A witch, cooking over a campfire.
2. A mouth-shaped double door with a keyhole on the western wall of the room.
3. A corpse of a human, an eye-shaped key nearby.
4. A mysterious, unnaturally light scarf on an altar.
5. A sign on the wall painted in blood: TURTLES ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM
