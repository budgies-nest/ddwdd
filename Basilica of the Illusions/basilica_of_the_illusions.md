# Basilica of the Illusions 

*For decades the basilica was considered lost. Lately a fearsome beholder has made its lair here.*

1. A travelling merchant, sleeping in a corner.
2. A huge ironbound door with two keyholes on the northern wall.
3. An ancient axe and some gold in a broken trunk.
4. A rear entrance into the basilica.
5. A crate with a key.
6. Remains of a bard, a lamp clutched in his hands.
7. A key among rubble on the ground.
